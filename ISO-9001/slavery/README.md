# ANTI-SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING POLICY

## 1. Policy statement

1.1    Slavery and human trafficking are crimes and a violation of human rights. We have a zero-tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking.

1.2     Slavery and human trafficking involve the deprivation of a person's liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain and encompasses practices such as: forced labour (i.e. involuntary work coerced by threatening behaviour); the sale and exploitation of children and other vulnerable groups; and arranging or enabling the trafficking of persons.

1.3    The following key principles apply to our business and suppliers:

- Child (under 16 years of age) labour must not be used and we and our suppliers must not benefit from child labour.
- Any form of forced or compulsory labour must not be used and we and our suppliers must not benefit from forced or compulsory labour. Workers must be free to leave employment or work after reasonable notice.
- Passports should not be taken from workers.
- All forms of debt bondage are prohibited. Workers should not be subject to contracts that tie them into repaying a loan, accommodation or some other costs that they have little opportunity to repay.
- Compensation and benefits must comply with fundamental principles relating to minimum wages, overtime hours and legally mandated benefits.
- The formation of trade unions and powers of collective bargaining should be respected.
- Workers should have safe and healthy working conditions that meet or exceed applicable standards for occupational safety and health.

1.4    We are committed to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery or human trafficking are not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.

1.5    We conduct risk assessments and due diligence on suppliers. We will not do business with suppliers who do not follow our anti-slavery and human trafficking principles.

1.6    On an annual basis we will publish an anti-slavery statement which will set out our approach to prevent slavery and human trafficking in connection with our business.
