## Infinity Works Third Party Property Management 
Last updated: June 2021, Pete Coulter 
<br>Date of next scheduled review: June 2022

## Introduction
This policy outlines our approach to managing matters related to third party property (TPP), providing guidelines and recommendations to ensure a level of consistency across Infinity Works (IW). 

# Definitions
For the purposes of this policy, TPP is defined as any physical item that is not owned by IW, but is provided to an IW employee/contractor in order to work on a specific client engagement. 

## Guidance
General guidance for TPP can be broken down based on the item type: 

# Type - IT Hardware (core)

Examples - Laptops. accessories, e.g. keyboards, mice

Guidance - Equipment should, if possible, be kept on/at the client site and stored securely as per the client’s own policy
If such items are removed from the client site or used remotely, IW consultants should adhere to the client’s relevant policy for equipment management
If no such policy exists then the relevant IW policies should be followed
If an item is damaged/lost whilst away from the client’s premises, this should be reported immediately to the client so their information security policies can be followed, as well as reporting the loss internally so IW can follow its own processes to handle such incidents

# Type - Office Access Passes 

Examples - Building access cards, ID passes 

Guidance - Access cards should be returned to the client (or client’s security team) as soon as possible once they are no longer required

# Type - IT Hardware (additional/uncommon)

Examples - Removable media storage, physical security devices (e.g. VPN/secure access fobs)

Guidance - Such items should be avoided due to the risk of losing small items

If their use is required, then the same guidance listed for IT Hardware (core) should be followed, with additional care taken to ensure items are kept safe and secure. 



## General Principles
Account/client specific requirements for TPP should be outlined in our Master Service Agreement and/or Statement(s) of Work with clients. 

The following principles can be used as general guidance / good practice: 
# Receiving 
When TPP is received, keep a log of the items, asset numbers (if applicable) and who is responsible for the item 
Only take receipt of TPP if it is essential for the completion of the agreed client work
Do not sign or accept any client equipment policies, these need to be agreed with a Managing Consultant in advance 

# Care & Communications 
Keep an up to date log of TPP issued to IW employees / consultants and share with the relevant client stakeholder 
Communicate in advance any changes (people joining/leaving the team) so that the client can follow their own internal processes 
Treat TPP with care, report any damages (cosmetic or functional) to the client ASAP 
If any TPP items are lost, report such instance immediately to the client and the IW Managing Consultant/Account Lead so that the relevant procedures can be followed
If you’re keeping TPP equipment at home or the IW office, ensure that it’s stored safe and secure to avoid any accidental damage 

# Returning
Keep a record of returned items
Obtain confirmation of the return from the client if possible and store such confirmations with the TPP log for the client/account 
Return items in person if possible - if this is not possible speak to a Managing Consultant/Account Lead to understand the return method, which should include recorded and insured delivery with proof of receipt from the receiving party. 
Unplanned returns (long term sickness, dismissal etc) - items should be handed over to the Account Lead who should ensure the relevant process & practices are followed
