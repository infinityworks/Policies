## Training Policy

At Infinity Works we have a collection of proven industry experts, each with many yearsâ€™ practical, hands-on experience in leading organisations around the globe. We pride ourselves in being practitioners at the coalface day in, day out. Our training service helps leverage this experience and knowledge into your team, helping to build capability and forge long lasting relationships with credible experts in their field.

1. Have a think about what benefit the training course or conference will provide. Why would it be valuable to attend, what will you learn as a result? Have a chat with your manager/ account lead to get their opinion. Also, would anyone else benefit? It could be worth considering who else might be interested too.

2. Have a conversation with your account lead and team to see if there's any timing challenges with the specific dates. For example, is it when lots of your colleagues are off, or just before a big deadline? Generally though as long as there's enough notice it should be fine.

3. If there's money involved (i.e. it's not a free course/conf or significant travel spend is required), speak to your Managing Consultant or someone on your local board. Please include all costs - i.e. ticket price, accommodation and travel so it's a total cost figure. Plus also your rationale around the benefit you feel it will bring and how you're thinking of sharing your knowledge and experience after the event.

4. Assuming you've been given the go ahead to attend, email your local office team to purchase the tickets and organise travel. Remember to include any discount codes included in the price you had approved.

5. Have a think about how you'll share your experience on your return. Writing a blog post or a short talk (for the mini conf etc) are great ways of sharing with your colleagues etc, and good learning opportunities in themselves.

6. Finally, update the training section and the skills inventory of your Bamboo profile to log the fact you've been. It's really useful to understand who's been on what and to help support and develop a well-rounded training strategy for IW, but also for you, to remember what you've done.
