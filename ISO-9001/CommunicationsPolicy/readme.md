# Communications Policy

## Introduction

This policy sets out to identify and articulate Infinity Works’ approach to communications and offers guidelines for professional use of platforms listed.

### Definition of communication

In the context of this policy, the definition of communication is the deliberate transfer of information from one party to another.

We have identified three types of communication which are central to the Infinity Works’ business, each having a clear accountable owner and a written statement covering responsibilities, mediums/channels and approval processes. These are represented in the following table.

|----|--------------|----------------|

* Feedback mechanisms e.g. C-Sat surveys.
* Policy communications e.g. BCP plans.
