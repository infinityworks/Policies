# Communications Policy

## Introduction

This policy sets out to identify and articulate Infinity Works’ approach to communications and offers guidelines for professional use of platforms listed.

### Definition of communication

In the context of this policy, the definition of communication is the deliberate transfer of information from one party to another.

We have identified three types of communication which are central to the Infinity Works’ business, each having a clear accountable owner and a written statement covering responsibilities, mediums/channels and approval processes. These are represented in the following table.

|Type|Accountability|Scope / Examples|
|----|--------------|----------------|
|External - Customer|Group Operations Director|<ul><li>Governance e.g. sprint reports, account reviews.</li><li>Feedback mechanisms e.g. C-Sat surveys.</li><li>Policy communications e.g. BCP plans.</li><li>Security alerts / breaches.</li><li>Informal e.g. driven by stakeholder maps.</li><li>Escalation / paths (inbound and outbound).</li></ul>|
|External - Marketing|Commercial Director|<ul><li>Emails to contacts and subscribers.</li><li>Updates to the public website.</li><li>Social media posts.</li><li>Sponsorship and affiliations.</li><li>Media relationships and press releases.</li></ul>|
|Internal - Staff|Director of People|<ul><li>Quarterly all-hands and regional business updates.</li><li>Policy and compliance updates e.g. security, H&S.</li><li>Informal e.g. Slack posts, IWTV.</li><li>Departmental newsletters.</li></ul>|

## External communications

External communications includes that which addresses the following audience types; prospects, customers, employees, potential employees, partners, and potential partners, and spans our digital assets including the four primary social media platforms on which we are active, the recruitment platments, our website, sales collateral, and ad-hoc news coverage and press releases.

### Customer communications

#### Emails

Communications may be sent to client individuals, groups of staff, or to all client staff, by email. Anyone with an IW email address is able to do this. 
Official communications are reviewed by the Senior Relationship Lead and aresent by the Managing Consultant.
Centrally controlled / mandated formal client communications are approved by the Group Operations Director before being executed by the Senior Relationship Lead and Managing Consultant.

#### Slack

Subject to the agreement with clients there are open lines of communication within Slack. Client staff can join as a guest via an invitation from a member of IW staff. This invite is to a specific client channel and does enable access to other clients or IW specific channels for security reasons. This form of channel communication works well for project &/or support related discussions.

Slack is only used for informal, day-to-day BAU communications between IW and client stakeholders. Official communications are never conducted via this medium.

#### Phone & Video

Phone-calls & teleconferences are made to clients to support project delivery, escalations, support queries and early engagements. These are a more personal communication offering a face or voice to a name and can help draw the emotive elements missed in written communications.
Formal communications, especially those of a sensitive nature, are always conducted verbally (either in person or via phone/video) with key senior stakeholders by the Senior Relationship Lead or Managing Consultant prior to being followed up in writing.

## Marketing communications

Marketing communications covers but is not limited to: email marketing communications, digital platforms (website and social media), sponsorships, and media relations.

### Email marketing communications

Email marketing communications are created to share news, info about events, and other relevant information with subscribers. Examples include e-newsletters, event invitations, and emails containing relevant content. Communications are only sent to subscribers who have ‘opted-in’ by providing explicit consent – via online or offline form – to receive marketing emails from Infinity Works. Individuals can unsubscribe at any time from marketing communications using the unsubscribe link included in all emails sent. All email marketing communications are created, reviewed, and delivered by the Commercial team via Infinity Works’ marketing automation platform, Pardot. Approval for the emails are sought by the relevant senior stakeholders, e.g. Commercial Director or Local Board, and approval is obtained via email.

### Website

Web pages are built on infinityworks.com to communicate the Infinity Works’ brand and its core messages to website visitors. All pages on our public website are built using our WordPress platform. For specific requirements, approved third-party agencies can build webpages on the relevant staging website before they are checked and approved by the Marketing Manager before they are deployed to the Infinity Works staging website. No web pages will be published or ‘go live’ without review and written approval (either via email or Slack) from an approved member of the Commercial Team (content owners). In certain situations, Legal will be asked to review pages relating to information such as pricing, and service area leaders will review specific pages e.g. cloud information.

### Social media

Social media allows Infinity Works to use, create, and share content, opinions, and insights through forms including text, imagery and video. The company has official pages/profiles on the following social networking sites: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Glassdoor. The pages/profiles are used to share company news, events, and information relevant to Infinity Works. Content is curated, created, and approved by the Marketing Manager on a daily basis.

### Sponsorships

The Commercial team will review strategic proposals for sponsorships and provide approval providing it meets the business’ needs. Approval to purchase sponsorship will take into account the strategic relevance of the sponsorship for the task defined, relevance of the selected sponsorship to Infinity Works’ target audience, and consistency with the company brand image. All agreements will be signed by the Commercial Director before starting any activity.
Media relations

To ensure all external communications are focussed and consistent, and to prevent running afoul of any regulations, all Infinity Works media relations and activities are managed centrally by the Commercial team, rather than through employees’ or teams’ own initiatives. This applies to the creation and distribution of any news/press releases, requests for media interviews, making announcements related to business developments, and participation in industry events. All media relations are approved by a minimum of two people at Director level within Infinity Works before publication. All media enquiries are directed to the Marketing Manager in the first instance to ensure any messages are accurate and consistent.
