# Communications Policy

## Introduction

This policy sets out to identify and articulate Infinity Works’ approach to communications and offers guidelines for professional use of platforms listed.

### Definition of communication

In the context of this policy, the definition of communication is the deliberate transfer of information from one party to another.

We have identified three types of communication which are central to the Infinity Works’ business, each having a clear accountable owner and a written statement covering responsibilities, mediums/channels and approval processes. These are represented in the following table.

|Type|Accountability|Scope / Examples|
|----|--------------|----------------|
|External - Customer|Group Operations Director|<ul><li>Governance e.g. sprint reports, account reviews.</li><li>Feedback mechanisms e.g. C-Sat surveys.</li><li>Policy communications e.g. BCP plans.</li><li>Security alerts / breaches.</li><li>Informal e.g. driven by stakeholder maps.</li><li>Escalation / paths (inbound and outbound).</li></ul>|
|External - Marketing|Commercial Director|<ul><li>Emails to contacts and subscribers.</li><li>Updates to the public website.</li><li>Social media posts.</li><li>Sponsorship and affiliations.</li><li>Media relationships and press releases.</li></ul>|

## External communications

External communications includes that which addresses the following audience types; prospects, customers, employees, potential employees, partners, and potential partners, and spans our digital assets including the four primary social media platforms on which we are active, the recruitment platments, our website, sales collateral, and ad-hoc news coverage and press releases.

### Customer communications

#### Emails

Communications may be sent to client individuals, groups of staff, or to all client staff, by email. Anyone with an IW email address is able to do this. 
Official communications are reviewed by the Senior Relationship Lead and aresent by the Managing Consultant.
Centrally controlled / mandated formal client communications are approved by the Group Operations Director before being executed by the Senior Relationship Lead and Managing Consultant.

#### Slack

Subject to the agreement with clients there are open lines of communication within Slack. Client staff can join as a guest via an invitation from a member of IW staff. This invite is to a specific client channel and does enable access to other clients or IW specific channels for security reasons. This form of channel communication works well for project &/or support related discussions.

Slack is only used for informal, day-to-day BAU communications between IW and client stakeholders. Official communications are never conducted via this medium.

#### Phone & Video

Phone-calls & teleconferences are made to clients to support project delivery, escalations, support queries and early engagements. These are a more personal communication offering a face or voice to a name and can help draw the emotive elements missed in written communications.
Formal communications, especially those of a sensitive nature, are always conducted verbally (either in person or via phone/video) with key senior stakeholders by the Senior Relationship Lead or Managing Consultant prior to being followed up in writing.
