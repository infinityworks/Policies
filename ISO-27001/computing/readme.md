# Computing Policy

## Overview

Allowing employees to be responsible for and manage both the operating system and the installed applications is a fundamental concept to the responsibility and culture at Infinity Works. This responsibility however, carries risk, a risk which needs to be managed. Risks include dependency conflicts which prevent programs from running, the introduction of malware and the use of unlicensed software. As a technology consultancy and inline with our culture, we allow the employee to take responsibility for ensuring compliance with this policy. However, we also reserve the right to restrict this for cases we feel is appropriate.

## Purpose

To outline the requirements of the consultants in maintaining their devices inline with company policies and in a secure fashion. Compliance with this policies mitigates key risks around the exposure of sensitive information contained within Infinity Works' computing network, the risk of introducing malware, the legal exposure of running unlicensed software and the potential breach of a device due to missing security patches.

## Scope

- This policy applies to all Infinity Works employees, contractors, vendors and agents with an Infinity Works-owned and managed device.
- Any Device used to store corporate information related to Infinity Works is in-scope of the policies set out here.

This policy covers all computers, servers, smartphones, tablets and other computing devices operating within Infinity Works.

## Policy

- Employees will have the ability to perform administrative actions on their device, unless explicitly revoked on an individual level by the ISMS.
- Administrator priveleges/accounts should only be used when explicitly required e.g. installing software or making configuration changes. Administrator accounts/priveleges should not be used for day-to-day activties e.g. accessing emails or web browsing.
  - For Windows devices, users should maintain separate administrator and standard user accounts. The standard account should be used for day-to-day activities. The administrator account should only be used to authorise priveleged operations when prompted or required, or switched into to perform an action.
  - For Mac devices, users may use a single user account where priveleged operations require authentication to authorise a priveleged operation. Where sudo is used, this must require authentication to authorise a priveleged operation. Sudo should only be used to run commands that explicitly require administrator privleges; sudo should not be used to run software or commands for day-to-day activities e.g. accessing emails or web browsing. 
- Employees may install software on computing devices operated within the Infinity Works network in order to perform their role / function, using the seperated admin account.
- All software must be appropriately licensed either by Infinity Works or by the user and must be supported with patches for security vulnerabilities.
- Operating system, firmware and application security patches must be applied within 14 days maximum of being made available. Where an application falls out of support and no longer has a mechanism to recieve such patches, it must be removed.
- All laptops and desktops must run company issued malware protection (ESET) with daily updates enabled and the web and email protections enabled, this is above and beyond the built-in OS controls.
- All laptops and desktops must have the local OS firewall enabled.
- All laptops and desktops must have full disk Encryption enabled, Filevault on Mac and Bitlocker on Windows.
- All users must take every measure to ensure that they do not inject malware onto Infinity Works systems and networks.
- The Administration/IT Team will obtain and track licenses owned by Infinity Works.
- All non-essential software should be removed when no longer relevant or required to ensure the security footprint of the device is minimised.
- For Windows users, Autoplay options must be disabled on the laptop/desktop.
- Infinity Works computational devices may be audited at any time.
- All laptops and desktops must have the Google Endpoint Verification plugin enabled and must ensure the device syncs at least every 30 days.
