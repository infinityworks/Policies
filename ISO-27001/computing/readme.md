# Computing Policy

## Overview

Allowing employees to be responsible for and manage both the operating system and the installed applications is a fundamental concept to the responsibility and culture at Infinity Works. This responsibility however, carries risk, a risk which needs to be managed. Risks include dependency conflicts which prevent programs from running, the introduction of malware and the use of unlicensed software. As a technology consultancy and inline with our culture, we allow the employee to take responsibility for ensuring compliance with this policy. However, we also reserve the right to restrict this for cases we feel is appropriate.

## Purpose

To outline the requirements of the consultants in maintaining their devices inline with company policies and in a secure fashion. Compliance with this policies mitigates key risks around the exposure of sensitive information contained within Infinity Works' computing network, the risk of introducing malware, the legal exposure of running unlicensed software and the potential breach of a device due to missing security patches.
