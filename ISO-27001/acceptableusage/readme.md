# Acceptable Usage Policy

## Definition

For the purposes of this document, references to "Infinity Works" refers also to their Customers (whether prospect or contracted) organisations and systems.

## Overview

Infinity Works intentions for publishing an Acceptable Use Policy are not to impose restrictions that are contrary to Infinity Works' established culture of openness, trust and integrity. Infinity Works is committed to protecting Infinity Works employees, partners and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.

Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including but not limited to computer equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network accounts providing electronic mail, WWW browsing, and FTP, are the property of Infinity Works. These systems are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of the company, our clients and customers in the course of normal operations. 

Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every Infinity Works employee and affiliate who deals with information and/or information systems. It is the responsibility of every computer user to know these guidelines and to conduct their activities accordingly.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer equipment at Infinity Works. These rules are in place to protect the employee and Infinity Works. Inappropriate use exposes Infinity Works to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and legal issues.

## Scope

This policy applies to the use of information, electronic and computing devices, and network resources to conduct Infinity Works business or interact with internal networks and business systems, whether owned or leased by Infinity Works, the employee or a third party. All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary, and other workers at Infinity Works and its subsidiaries are responsible for exercising good judgement regarding appropriate use of information, electronic devices, and network resources in accordance with Infinity Works' policies and standards, and local laws and regulations. Exceptions to this policy are documented in the Policy Compliance section of this document.

This policy applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and other workers at Infinity Works, including all personnel affiliated with third parties. This policy applies to all equipment that is owned or leased by Infinity Works.

## Policy

### General Use and Ownership

Infinity Works proprietary information stored on electronic and computing devices whether owned or leased by Infinity Works, the employee, consultant, contractor, temporary or other worker or a third party, remains the sole property of Infinity Works. You must ensure through legal or technical means that proprietary information is protected in accordance with the Data Protection Policy.

You have a responsibility to promptly report the theft, loss or unauthorized disclosure of Infinity Works proprietary information.

You may access, use or share Infinity Works proprietary information only to the extent it is authorized and necessary to fulfil your assigned job duties.

Employees are responsible for exercising good judgement regarding the reasonableness of personal use. Individual departments are responsible for creating guidelines concerning personal use of Internet/Intranet/Extranet systems. In the absence of such policies, employees should be guided by departmental policies on personal use, and if there is any uncertainty, employees should consult their Advocate, Account Manager, Line Manager, Operations Manager or a Director.

For security and network maintenance purposes, authorized individuals within Infinity Works may monitor equipment, systems and network traffic at any time.

Infinity Works reserves the right to audit networks and systems on a periodic basis to ensure compliance with this policy.

## Security and Proprietary Information

The security of Infinity Works systems, data and the integrity of our customers systems and data is paramount. All devices in-scope as per the scoping detailed above are subject to the Acceptable Use policy, these devices are expected to be used in conjunction with the services provided by Infinity Works, either directly or through a third party service provider on our behalf. These systems are audited and configured inline with the policies set out here. At times, it might become appropriate to engage with systems outside of this, when doing so they must NOT be used to store information private to either Infinity Works, or our customers. The only exception to this would be services managed by our customers where it's acceptable to store data about that customer, inline with their security policy. 

If you wish to use such a system to store data, please raise it with ISMS comittee, who can assist in getting in on-boarded if appropriate.

For the devices and accounts used to fufill you're role, system level and user level passwords must comply with the Password Policy. Providing access to another individual, either deliberately or through failure to secure its access, is prohibited.

Employees must use extreme caution when sending confidential data over email. You must also be very cautious opening e-mail attachments received from unknown senders, which may contain malware.

### Unacceptable Use

The following activities are, in general, prohibited. Employees may be exempted from these restrictions during the course of their legitimate job responsibilities (e.g., disabling key services to support troubleshooting).

Under no circumstances is an employee of Infinity Works authorized to engage in any activity that is illegal under UK, European or international law while utilising Infinity Works-owned resources.

The lists below are by no means exhaustive, but attempt to provide a framework for activities which fall into the category of unacceptable use.

- Providing information about, or lists of, Infinity Works employees to parties outside Infinity Works, unless this activity is a part of the employee's normal job/duty and is in accordance with Infinity Works' Employee and Contractor Privacy Notice.

#### Priviledged Utility Programs

The very nature of the role we ask our consultants to facilitate requires them to interact with the operating system and software at a deep level, for example many of our staff develop software on low level technologies such as containerisation and virtualisation. Privileged access and subsequent modifications to the system, either directly or through utility programs is part of the duties of their role. When undertaking such tasks, staff must abide by good practice and have a clear understanding of the security implications.

Whilst modifications to support their duties are supported by Infinity Works, any modifications made to a system with the intention, or impact of breaching any of our policies as defined will be managed through our disciplinary process as per the policy guidance.
