# Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy

Infinity Works grants its employees the privilege of purchasing and using computing devices of their choosing at work for their convenience. Infinity Works reserves the right to revoke this privilege if users do not abide by the policies and procedures outlined below.

This policy is intended to protect the security and integrity of Infinity Works's data and technology infrastructure. Limited exceptions to the policy may occur due to variations in devices and platforms.

Infinity Works employees must agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this policy in order to be able to connect their devices to the company network & services.

## Acceptable Use

Usage of a personal device must abide by the restrictions set out in the [Acceptable Use Policy](../acceptableusage/readme.md) and the [computing policy](../computing/readme.md). The device must also be configured and used in-line with the other security policies set out by Infinity Works.

In order to bring your own device and use it for work purposes, the device must be up-to-date and secure, meeting the requirements of relevant policies, e.g. [Laptop Policy](../device/readme.md).

## Devices and Support

* If in doubt whether you should use the device, discuss with a member of the ISMS Committee.

## Reimbursement

* The company may reimburse the employee for usage of devices at their discretion through the existing expenses process. 

## Security

* In order to prevent unauthorised access it is required that all devices be protected using security features of the device, e.g. using screen lock, fingerprint recognition.
* Devices must be locked (e.g. with a password or PIN) if left idle.

## Termination of Employment

* In the event of termination of employment, the employee must remove all company data and software owned by the company from their personal device. See the [Leaving Policy](../leaving/readme.md) for more details.

## Risks/Liabilities/Disclaimers

* Infinity Works reserves the right to disconnect devices or disable services without notification.
* Lost or stolen devices must be reported to the company within 24 hours so that attempts to contact are not made. Employees are responsible for notifying their mobile carrier immediately upon loss of a device.
* Employees are expected to use their devices in an ethical manner at all times, and adhere to the companyâ€™s acceptable use policy as outlined above.
* Employees are personally liable for all costs associated with their devices.
* The employee assumes full liability for the risk of the device becoming inoperable or damaged while carrying out work for Infinity Works, e.g. by dropping the device, or the device being hacked.
* Infinity Works reserves the right to take appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination for noncompliance with this policy.
