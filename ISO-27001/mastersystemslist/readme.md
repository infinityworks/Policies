# Master Systems List

This is a list of the key systems that underpin the Infinity Works business. This document covers technology services and not physical facilities that support our regional offices. Any systems that underpin our clients are governed by the support structure and processes agreed with that client for the engagement and are not detailed in this document.

## Service Classification

Services are classified based on two criteria, their importance to our business operations (Internal Classification) and their importance to our customer implementations and accounts.

Internal Classification

- A - Priority System, critical to the ongoing operation of the business
- B - Key system, but one which the business can operate withouth, our efficiency would be impacted.
- C - Supplementry service, suitable workarounds exist
