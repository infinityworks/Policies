#  Business Continuity
This policy outlines how we react to external events (e.g loss of access to our offices due to a fire) in order to continue to conduct business.

**The Infinity Works Business Continuity Plan can be found on the (TD) ISO Team drive.**

## General principles

* We do not rely on the availability of our office building
  * Fallback positions are discussed with clients, and may include staff: 
    * Working from home
    * Working from client sites
    * Working from alternative locations (e.g. rented office space)
* As per our [Backup Policy](../backup/readme.md)
  * We use cloud services to remove our reliance on physical infrastructure and buildings
* As per our [Network Systems Policy](../networksystems/readme.md) and [Virus Protection Policy](../virusprotection/readme.md) we consider all networks as both inherently insecure and replaceable with any Internet connection meaning that we don't need our network to function
* Our main Staff communication channels (Slack and Google Mail) are both global in scale, independent and cloud-hosted
  * Secondary communication could be provided by telephone if required
  * We store a directory of staff contact details in our Google and Slack directories
* All systems that underpin our business have workarounds in-place should they be unavailable, see our [Master Systems List](../mastersystemslist/readme.md)

## Event handling process

* In the case of a building evacuation, or any other event which could cause the loss of access to an office or the loss of the utility of that office (e.g. loss of Internet connection), the Office Manager or regional operations director will send out a message on Slack and email notifying everyone to avoid the office until further notice. If the closure affects multiple offices then the exec will issue notice through both email and slack of the closures.
* Regular updates will be provided so that everyone knows the current situation.
* When the situation is resolved, communications will be sent through on both slack and email
